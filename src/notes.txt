Thoughts

Initially creating the 2d rendering of a car track and racing line was easy. Ran into issues not using the correct car object, which
caused the car not to be rendered onto the track.
Second step was creating an edit mode, that could edit the track to different dimensions. Simple edit mode that calls the component
was an easy implementation.
Third step is where the real research will begin. I'm going to start by implementing vehicle dynamics, which includes tire friction
weight transferring and perhaps if not too difficult, aerodynamics.
To begin the documentation process, I have found the book called Vehicle dynamics theory and application by Reza N. Jazar.
